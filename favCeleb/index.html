			<h3>1992–2012: Early life, Education and Omo Baba Olowo</h3>
			<p>
				David Adedeji Adeleke was born on November 21, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. His father Adedeji Adeleke is a business magnate from Nigeria and his mother Vero Adeleke was a university lecturer. Davido is the youngest of five siblings and his father's third-born son. He attended the British International School in Lagos, and at the age of 16, he returned to the U.S. to study business administration at Oakwood University, Alabama.

					While at Oakwood, Davido bought musical equipment and started making beats. He also formed the music act KB International with his cousins B-Red and Sina Rambo. Davido dropped out of Oakwood University to pursue music full-time and relocated to London, where he worked on his vocals. After returning to Nigeria in 2011, Davido paused his music career and agreed to honor his father by enrolling at Babcock University, from which he graduated in July 2015, with a degree in music after his father paid the university to start a music department for an inaugural class of one student.

					in 2011, Davido started working on his debut studio album Omo Baba Olowo, which is a mixture of Afrobeats and hip hop. Davido worked with Jay Sleek, Maleek Berry, GospelOnDeBeatz, Spellz, Dokta Frabz, Mr. Chidoo, Theory Soundz and Shizzi to produce the album. Omo Baba Olowo features guest appearances from Naeto C, Sina Rambo, B-Red, Kayswitch, Ice Prince and 2 Face Idibia. It received generally negative reviews from music critics, who panned its lyrical content and Davido's songwriting. The album won Best R&B/Pop Album and received a nomination for Album of the Year at The Headies 2013, and for Best Album of the Year at the 2013 Nigeria Entertainment Awards.

					The Naeto C-assisted track "Back When" was released as the album's lead single on May 7, 2011. It was produced in London by Davido and received frequent airplay. The Clarence Peters-directed music video for "Back When" was uploaded to YouTube on May 9, 2011. Davido and Shizzi produced the album's second single "Dami Duro", which was released on October 30, 2011. In an interview posted on the NotJustOk website, Davido said he recorded the song in August of that year. The song was leaked three months after he sent it to some of his friends. The accompanying music video for "Dami Duro" was released on January 8, 2012, during the Occupy Nigeria protests.

					The album's third single "Ekuro" was released on January 25, 2012. Its music video was recorded and directed in Miami by Antwan Smith. Nigerian singer Aramide released a soulful cover of the song. The album's fourth single "Overseas" was released on May 6, 2012; an unfinished version of the song was leaked prior to its official release. The GospelOnDeBeatz-produced track "All of You" was released as the album's fifth

					single on September 28, 2012; Davido said he recorded the song with GospelOnDeBeatz' whom he met at a mall.

"Skelewu" was supported with two music videos; the first was directed by Sesan and released on October 15, 2013. It was uploaded to YouTube using a parody account.

				Davido's album The Baddest was scheduled for release in June 2015 but its release was postponed to October 10 that year.
